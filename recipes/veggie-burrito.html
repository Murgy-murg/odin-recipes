    <h3>Our delicious ultimate veggie burrito that we think you will just love !</h3>
    <p>While I was developing this recipe, I had to really rack my brain on what creates the ULTIMATE homemade veggie burrito. In my opinion, it needs to include fillings that are hearty enough to make up for the lack of meat. It also needs to have enough texture so you're not just biting into mush.
    Additionally, the burrito needs to have brightness and acidity without being watered down by tomato-based salsa or pico. And lastly, the ingredients need to be freezer-friendly! So bearing all of this in mind, I present you with the ultimate homemade vegetarian burrito recipe.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp lime zest plus 1 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 poblano pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion</li>
        <li>2 tbsp taco seasoning</li>
        <li>can of black beans</li>
        <li>2 tbsp adobo sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>6 burrito sized tortillas</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Prepare Zesty Avocado Cream Sauce: To a food processor, add avocado, cilantro, sour cream (or Greek yogurt), jalapeño, garlic, lime juice, and salt. Blend mixture, stopping to scrap down the sides as needed, until mostly smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare Cilantro-Lime Rice: In a small saucepan, combine dry rice with 2 cups of water and ½ tsp. salt. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and gently simmer for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and rice is tender.
            Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoon of the olive oil, chopped fresh cilantro, lime zest, and lime juice. Keep covered while you prepare remaining components.</li>
        <li>Sauté Fajita Veggies: While the rice cooks, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add bell peppers, poblano pepper, and red onion. Cook 7 to 9 minutes, stirring only occasionally, until tender. Stir in 1 Tbsp. taco seasoning and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Prepare Chipotle Black Beans: Drain and lightly rinse black beans. Shake off excess water and transfer to a bowl. Stir in adobo sauce, ground cumin, and remaining ¼ tsp. salt. Cover with a damp paper towel and microwave for 2 minutes, stopping at 1 minute to stir through, until warm.</li>   
        <li>Assemble and Roll Burritos:
            Working with one burrito at a time, spread 2 Tbsp. of avocado cream sauce in a strip (running parallel to you) across the bottom third of the tortilla, leaving a 1-inch edge on the left and right sides so the fillings don't spill out when you roll it.
            Top with a heaping ⅓ cup rice, ⅓ cup black beans, and a heaping ⅓ cup fajita veggies.
            To wrap the burritos, fold the short left and right edges in towards the filling. Keeping the sides folded, fold the bottom of the tortilla (closest to you) up and over the filling. Tightly roll away from you until the entire burrito is secure. If you'd like to crisp the outside of the burrito, heat in a lightly greased skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes per side. 
            Enjoy immediately or follow storage instructions in notes below.</li>
